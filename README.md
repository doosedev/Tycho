# Tycho
## STACY-Based High Powered Datalogger Firmware
### Developed by Jordan Doose

# Getting Started
## Dependencies
- VSCode
- PlatformIO
- STACY Hardware

## Setting Up Your Workspace
Development of Tycho requires the use of the PlatformIO IDE extension for
VSCode, and all firmware is written in C++ using the Arduino library. STACY
flight computer hardware is required for software testing and so is therefore
a dependency for contribution.
1. Clone the repository to your location of choice
2. Navigate to either the `MCU_fw` or `NAV_fw` folders
3. Open either folder in VSCode to load the project in PlatformIO
4. Wait for dependency collection & IntelliSense index construction

## Testing
Testing requirements, when finalized, will be available [here](#)
